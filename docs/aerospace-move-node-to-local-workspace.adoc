== Description

// tag::body[]
Moves the selected window to the workspace occupying the given slot on the monitor
that currently owns that window. Slot indexes are 1-based and scoped to each monitor.

If the slot is empty, a stub workspace is created on that monitor and the window is
sent there. This command requires `[general] workspace_mode = "per-monitor"`;
otherwise it fails with an error to avoid ambiguity with the global workspace list.

// =========================================================== Options
include::util/conditional-options-header.adoc[]

-h, --help:: Print help
--window-id::<window-id> to move instead of the currently focused window
--focus-follows-window:: Focus the destination workspace after the window is moved
--fail-if-noop:: Exit with non-zero status when the window is already on that slot

// =========================================================== Examples
include::util/conditional-examples-header.adoc[]

* Send the focused window to slot 5 of its current monitor (and follow it): +
`aerospace move-node-to-local-workspace --focus-follows-window 5`
